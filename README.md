# Angular Routes
Prime project. The purpose of this project was to use AngularJS routing to serve HTML pages, using a service file and separate controllers for each page view. Each page has a character that the user can interact with, and "high five". The quality of the high five is a randomly generated number, and the counter displays the number of successful high fives (if the quality number exceeds that of each character's skill level) over the number of attempts.

## Technology used
Angular, JavaScript, CSS, HTML. Focus on using controllers and service, and ng-if's.
